  # These commented lines were an attempt to serve Grafana from :80/grafana
  # and Prometheus from :80/prometheus .  The top pages served correctly but
  # the static content from both services continued to be served from :80/ .
  # I got Grafana to work by adding paths for all its static content from :80/ .
  # But that potentially conflicts with static content from other services and
  # indeed it conflicted with Prometheus, which also wanted to serve content from :80/api.
  #
  # The next FOUR paths are all for Grafana.  The first is for the base page,
  # the next three for the static resources that page loads.
  # This is a TERRIBLE way to organize this virtual service, as it
  # means if any OTHER service on port 80 wants to load from these
  # routes, that service will fail.
